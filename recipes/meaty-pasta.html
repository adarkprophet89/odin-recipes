        <h2>My go-to "one pot" pasta recipe</h2>
        <p>Whenever I don't have any other ideas for dinner and I want to have something that still gives me the "home cooked meal" feeling I whip this up. It's pretty simple and uses ingredients I <em>pretty</em> much have all the time. Since getting a nice dutch oven I've been putting it under the broiler to finish off but even if that's not an option this still makes a nice homemade tasting, cheesy, filling pasta without having to use two different pots/pans.</p>
        <p>I'm learning how to code here, not making an official recipe site so ingredients, measurements, utensils, and some other things I'm not thinking of are up to your interpretation and are usually listed to the best of my memory. I don't measure everything, I started with a recipe for a sauce, then an idea for how to cook a pasta and sauce together in one pot, and cobbled it all together with some things I learned over watching <strong>way</strong> too many Youtube cooking videos.</p>
        <p>Ideally this feeds 4 and takes 30-45 minutes but I'm usually cooking for just me and my girlfriend and I don't time myself so I'm sure I take longer.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 yellow or sweet onion diced</li>
            <li>8oz of baby bella mushrooms cut into 1/4" slices</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef (I like 80/20 but you do you)</li>
            <li>2-3 cloves of crushed garlic</li>
            <li>A few tablespoons (eyeballed) of dry vermouth. If you have a dry wine that you'd prefer, red would probably be appropriate, feel free to use that. You could substitute beef broth or even water also.</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 can of peeled, whole, San Marzano tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoon italian seasoning (I blend a teaspoon each dried oregano, basil, thyme, sometimes rosemary or parsley, whatever I'm feeling really)</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes (I just eyeball this)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>salt and pepper (to taste at each stage I mention adding it)</li>
            <li>1 box rotini pasta (or whichever shape you'd like)</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 cup? (I don't measure this) shredded mozzarella</li>
            <li>however much grated parmesan your heart desires (I <strong>highly</strong> recommend grating it fresh and using parmigiano reggiano instead of generic grated parmesan)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a dutch oven, large pot, or high walled saute pan preheat over medium high heat. Once hot add the ground beef and press it down until it covers the bottom of the pan and is making as much contact as you can get. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until the bottom has some good browning, before flipping and repeating. Once both sides have some good color begin breaking up into chunks. If you want a really fine crumble I recommend switching from whatever spoon or spatula you start with to a potato masher. Continue breaking up and stirring until the beef is cooked through and no red is visible. Season to taste with salt and pepper (I tend to use some garlic powder too). If you used 80/20 beef like I do you shouldn't have needed to add any oil to the pot. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon and set aside in a medium bowl. There should be some rendered fat left behind and hopefully some good fond.</li>
            <li>Add the onion to the pot (with some olive oil if needed) and season to taste with salt. Cook until softened, 2-3 minutes, before adding the mushrooms. Cook another 2-3 minutes until all the veg is softened and the onions are translucent. Make a space in the center, add some olive oil to the empty space, and crush in the garlic. Wait 30-45 seconds, until its fragrance fills the room, and stir everything together.</li>
            <li>Add the vermouth and stir well, using your spoon/spatula to scrape up any fond that might be on the bottom of the pot. Cook another minute or two until the vermouth is reduced and little to no extra liquid remains.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato paste and combine with the veg. Cook a minute or two until the paste becomes caramelized and loosens up. Add the beef back to pot and combine everything together.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low and add the can of tomatoes with the all the sauce inside. Break up the tomatoes with your utensil of choice, either mashing against the bottom, chopping it with the edge, or pressing it against the side of the pot. If you really like the experience of it you might like to break up the tomatoes individually by hand, if you do just watch out for any juice that might spray out (I've made some big messes doing this).</li>
            <li>Add the sugar, vinegar, italian seasoning, and pepper flakes, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Make any seasoning tweaks or additions you might want for the sauce now, cause here is where I go from making a sauce from close to scratch and turn this into a sort of lazy one pot dinner.</li>
            <li>Add the box of pasta and the water. Combine everything together until the pasta is well mixed into the sauce. Cover the pot with a lid and continue cooking on low heat for 20 minutes, stirring once halfway through, until the pasta is cooked.</li>
            <li>Once cooked add some mozzarella and parmigiano, ideally half of the total amount you want to end up adding, and combine until you have strings of cheese stretching between all the pasta and other solids. Add the rest of the cheese to the top and put the pot in the oven under the broiler on high until the cheese is melted and a little browned. Before I had an oven safe dutch oven I'd just close the lid until the cheese melted instead.</li>
            <li>Serve with the garnishes of your liking. My go to's are some more grated parmigiano, fresh ground black pepper, and if I have any fresh parsley or basil a sprinkle of one of them chopped up.</li>
