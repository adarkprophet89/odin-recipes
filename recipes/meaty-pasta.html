        <h2>My go-to "one pot" pasta recipe</h2>
        <p>Whenever I don't have any other ideas for dinner and I want to have something that still gives me the "home cooked meal" feeling I whip this up. It's pretty simple and uses ingredients I <em>pretty</em> much have all the time. Since getting a nice dutch oven I've been putting it under the broiler to finish off but even if that's not an option this still makes a nice homemade tasting, cheesy, filling pasta without having to use two different pots/pans.</p>
        <p>Ideally this feeds 4 and takes 30-45 minutes but I'm usually cooking for just me and my girlfriend and I don't time myself so I'm sure I take longer.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 yellow or sweet onion diced</li>
            <li>8oz of baby bella mushrooms cut into 1/4" slices</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef (I like 80/20 but you do you)</li>
            <li>2-3 cloves of crushed garlic</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 can of peeled, whole, San Marzano tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoon italian seasoning (I blend a teaspoon each dried oregano, basil, thyme, sometimes rosemary or parsley, whatever I'm feeling really)</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes (I just eyeball this)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>salt and pepper (to taste at each stage I mention adding it)</li>
            <li>1 box rotini pasta (or whichever shape you'd like)</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 cup? (I don't measure this) shredded mozzarella</li>
            <li>however much grated parmesan your heart desires</li>
        </ul>
