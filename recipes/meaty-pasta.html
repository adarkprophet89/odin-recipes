        <h2>My go-to "one pot" pasta recipe</h2>
        <p>Whenever I don't have any other ideas for dinner and I want to have something that still gives me the "home cooked meal" feeling I whip this up. It's pretty simple and uses ingredients I <em>pretty</em> much have all the time. Since getting a nice dutch oven I've been putting it under the broiler to finish off but even if that's not an option this still makes a nice homemade tasting, cheesy, filling pasta without having to use two different pots/pans.</p>
        <p>Ideally this feeds 4 and takes 30-45 minutes but I'm usually cooking for just me and my girlfriend and I don't time myself so I'm sure I take longer.</p>
