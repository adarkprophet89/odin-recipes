    <h2>My current favorite day off breakfast</h2>
    <p>I love avocados (who tf doesn't?), I love a fried egg (fight me if you don't). This takes both things, puts them on toast, and can take a variety of toppings or sauces. This recipe will include my current go to which is honey, sriracha, and chili crisp. I like to have a couple slices of bacon with this, which I fry before the eggs so I can cook the eggs in the bacon grease (mmmm, healthy). If you want to <strong>actually</strong> try to be healthy substitute any cooking oil or butter for this.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 avocado</li>
        <li>two eggs</li>
        <li>bacon (optional)</li>
        <li>2 slices of bread</li>
        <li>everything bagel seasoning (optional)</li>
        <li>8 cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>honey</li>
        <li>sriracha</li>
        <li>teaspoon-ish chili crisp</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If you are down with bacon, start here, if not then skip to the next step. Add the bacon to a nonstick pan, then turn the heat on to medium.</li>
        <li>While the bacon begins to cook, cut the avocado open and scoop out the flesh into a bowl. If you've never learned how <a href="https://youtu.be/texyKNGt4iU" target="_blank">watch here</a>. I cube it before scooping it out of the skin, then mash it once it's in the bowl.</li>
        <li>Toast your slices of bread by your preferred method, to your preferred toastiness.</li>
        <li>Cut the cherry tomatoes width wise into quarters and season with salt.</li>
        <li>When the toast is ready spread half of the avocado on each piece of toast. Optionally season liberally with everything bagel seasoning. Top with the tomato pieces, evenly spaced to cover the toast. I try to get it so I get a little piece of tomato in each bite.</li>
        <li>The way I've managed to time this I'm usually just finishing this portion of the toast assembly by the time my bacon's done to my liking. If you aren't using bacon (or just not using the bacon grease) heat up your lubricant of choice over medium heat in the pan, then crack in the eggs, seasoning immediately with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook the eggs to your liking (I'm partial to over-easy), then remove from the pan and right on top of the toast, one egg per slice.</li>
        <li>At this point it's time to add toppings, feel free to go wherever you want with it. I currently like to drizzle first honey then sriracha over mine, then scoop a teaspoon or so (like an actual teaspoon not the measuring spoon) of chili crisp, and then spread the chili crisp and it's oil all over. I've also gone the route of just dashing Cholula over it and calling it a day. You could also try fresh basil chopped fine with a drizzle of EVOO, really you can go anywhere with this.</li>
    </ol>
