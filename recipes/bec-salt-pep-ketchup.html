    <h2>A bodega/deli staple that makes my mouth water even thinking about</h2>
    <p>Hailing originally from NJ, I can't leave out the crown jewel of all breakfast sandwiches: The bacon egg and cheese. Enter any bagel shop on a weekday morning and you'll overhear at least one other patron order this sandwich, usually with salt pepper and ketchup, usually pronounced all as one word "baconeggandcheesesaltpepperketchup". Though I think this is usually more sought out for it's consistency across any place you might be able to order one and convenience during a morning commute, making it at home can be pretty satisfying. My version is messy as hell, with melty cheese mingling with runny egg yolk and maybe a stray drop of ketchup, but don't you dare eat this with a fork and knife, you heathens.</p>
