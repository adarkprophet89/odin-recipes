    <h2>A bodega/deli staple that makes my mouth water even thinking about</h2>
    <p>Hailing originally from NJ, I can't leave out the crown jewel of all breakfast sandwiches: The bacon egg and cheese. Enter any bagel shop on a weekday morning and you'll overhear at least one other patron order this sandwich, usually with salt pepper and ketchup, usually pronounced all as one word "baconeggandcheesesaltpepperketchup". Though I think this is usually more sought out for it's consistency across any place you might be able to order one and convenience during a morning commute, making it at home can be pretty satisfying. My version is messy as hell, with melty cheese mingling with runny egg yolk and maybe a stray drop of ketchup, but don't you dare eat this with a fork and knife, you heathens.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 strips bacon</li>
        <li>bread of choice (I go for an everything bagel)</li>
        <li>2 slices American cheese</li>
        <li>salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>pepper (to taste)</li>
        <li>ketchup (you guessed it)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Toast your bread by desired method to desired toastiness (or don't if you like it untoasted)</li>
        <li>Add the bacon to a cold non-stick pan, then cook over medium heat until cooked to your preference.</li>
        <li>I like to cook my eggs in the bacon grease for it's flavor but if you don't then drain the grease and melt a tablespoon of butter in the pan, or add the oil of your choice, enough to coat the pan.</li>
        <li>Crack in the eggs and cook them how you like them (as mentioned in the description, I'm going with over-easy). Be sure to season immediately with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>When the eggs are maybe halfway cooked top each wit a slice of cheese. If you want to help the cheese melt faster adding a bit of water to the pan and covering it with a lid speeds things up</li>
        <li>Once cooked stack the eggs, one on top of the other, on the bottom half of the bagel. Top with bacon, then a swirl of ketchup.</li>
        <li>Cut in half so the yolk starts oozing over each half of the sandwich and dig in!</li>
    </ol>
